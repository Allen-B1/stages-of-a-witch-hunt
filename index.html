<!--
Artist's Note: This is an exploration of the parallels between cancel culture,
    the Salem witch trials, and McCarthyism. I categorize the lifetime of such
    a "witch hunt" into four stages: fear, accusations, paranoia, and down-
    fall. That idea was inspired by the commonly known stages of a revolution
    that we learned in 9th and 10th grade history. For the most part, all three
    examples follow the trajectory, although cancel culture is a bit different,
    due to it being driven from the bottom-up more than the others.

            <h1>STAGES OF A WITCH HUNT</h1>
            <p>From the Salem witch trials to McCarthyism to modern-day "cancel culture", all "witch hunts," characterized by a low standard of evidence, the lack of immunity to persecution, and an almost-religious accusatory fervor, follow an all-too-predictable pattern.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section step">
            <div>
                <h2>1: Fear</h2>
                <p>All witch hunts start with a legitimate threat to the well-being of society. Without such a threat, the initial accusations would never take place; the later stages would never gain any sort of legitimacy whatsoever.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <p class="item"><b>McCarthyism:</b> The Soviet Union was the United States's biggest rival as a fellow superpower. The USSR's official ideology was Marxist-Leninism which in practice looked like authoritarian socialism that many Americans were afraid of. Most (not all (see: Eurocommunism), but most) Communist parties worldwide had at this point become uncritical of the Soviet Union and often aided it in its foreign policy goals. The Communist Party of America (CPUSA), although it denied it at the time, received funding from the Soviet Union. Spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Alger Hiss were found working within the government.
            </p>
            <p class="item"><b>Salem witch trials:</b> Although witchcraft was (and is) not real, the effects that were attributed to it were definitely real. The girls were described as having fits that were "beyond the power of epileptic fits or natural disease to effect" by Reverend Hale. The victims reported having feeling pinched and pricked with pins. Today, some hypothesize that these effects were caused by the Claviceps purpurea fungus, a component of LSD.</p>
            <p class="item"><b>Cancel culture:</b> Sexual harassment and assault are real. Bigotry and its subsequent oppression and discrimination are also real. The #MeToo movement started with (and continues to consist of) largely accurate accusations of rape. Cancel culture (or call-out culture) started out as a mechanism for keeping those accountable that could otherwise not have been held accountable. As popular YouTuber ContraPoints says, "The promise of canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none, and bring justice to prominent abusers." It weaponized public opinion and social media against abusive people in positions of power.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section step">
            <div>
            <h2>2: Accusations</h2>
            <p>A few people get accused of being part of the threat to society. These cases might be mostly legitimate, or they might be perceived as totally legitimate. Over time, more and more accusations are made and the standard of evidence drops. At this point, some people will use the accusatory environment for their own personal gain. Public opinion is used so that nobody, not even the most powerful, is safe.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="item"><b>McCarthyism:</b> The notorious interrogation of people suspected to have Communist sympathies. Initially, many liberals were sympathetic towards the accused, but when it turned out that many of the accused were actually present or former Communist party members, liberal anti-communism grew. A blacklist was created, which ended many artists' careers.            </p>
            <p class="item"><b>Salem witch trials:</b> At first, there are only three accused: Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne. But more and more girls become "bewitched," and the number of "witches" grows. The trials are weaponized by the Putnams against their political enemies.</p>
            <p class="item"><b>Cancel culture:</b> At first, accusations successfully topple abusive people. However, the promise of cancel culture, of giving power to those that previously had none, along with the fast-attention-span low-critical-thinking nature of social media means that there is no difference between true and false accusations. Occasionally, cancel culture is intentionally created by a powerful person (the very people that were supposed to not be benefiting from it) in order to damage their rivals (see: Tati Westbrook / James Charles drama).</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section step">
            <div>
            <h2>3: Paranoia</h2>
            <p>Accusations create a culture of fear, because of the universality of the accusations. Defending an unjust conviction is seen as proof that you are part of the threat to society. This creates a positive feedback loop wherein the standard of evidence is further dropped because of the dangers of being on the side of the defendant. A groupthink effect is developed, despite the fact that most people may have changed to not support the accusations anymore.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="item"><b>McCarthyism:</b> The accusations create a ritualized fervor and a culture of paranoia that later cause many non-(present-or-former)-communists to be hurt by false accusations. McCarthy named the names of more than 2000 federal employees without any substantial evidence, which had real-world consequences for their careers. In Hollywood, a "graylist" was created of people who, despite not being Communists, were denied employment at many studios.</p>
            <p class="item"><b>Salem witch trials:</b> Anyone who dares speak out against the trials is convicted of being in on the plot. The Nurses and Coreys, powerful members of the community, are successfully targeted; no one is immune. 20 people are executed, 19 by hanging and 1 by crushing.</p>
            <p class="item"><b>Cancel culture:</b> Those who are critical of cancel culture are labeled by some as bigots and reactionaries by the left. People who defend people that are canceled are themselves canceled. This creates an environment where when somebody is targeted, they become isolated.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section step">
            <div>
            <h2>4: Downfall</h2>
            <p>Someone powerful enough is targeted that it leads to backlash. This causes the unraveling of the feedback loop: public opinion, at the time perhaps not entirely in favor of the accusations, can be turned against the accusations; the fact that someone successfully spoke out against the accusations makes accusations less powerful.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="item"><b>McCarthyism:</b> Various members of the army are targeted, and they expose how much of a sham McCarthyism is. Because the proceedings were televised, the public saw for the first time how unjust the process was. Echoing public opinion, Joseph Welch, an attorney for the army, asks rhetorically : "Have you no decency, sir?" McCarthy is censured, and the HUAC changes name in an attempt to save face before ultimately being disbanded.            </p>
            <p class="item"><b>Salem witch trials:</b> The governor's wife is targeted; he springs into action after months of inaction. The Court of Oyer and Terminer is ordered to disband, and a new court is created in its place: the Superior Court of Judicature, which doesn't accept spectral evidence. The indictments start to fail to become convictions and any remaining people to be executed are pardoned.</p>
            <p class="item"><b>Cancel culture:</b> Unlike the other two instances, there is no downfall, at least not yet. The left as a whole has begun to be more critical of cancel culture, but it still exists and it still has very real consequences.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section" style="height: 130vh">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While all 3 examples are similar in many ways, one stands out: cancel culture. Unlike the other two, it is not driven from the top-down, but from the bottom-up. This is why it doesn't go away: even if many people turn against it, the people who engage in it aren't affected, since they aren't bound to public opinion. Social media continues to encourage low attention spans and low critical thinking, and until that changes cancel culture is likely to continue.</p>
